# ComputableFunctions
An accompaniment to the MoC CW2

Credit to Csongor Kiss (https://github.com/kcsongor) for help with refactoring. And to James Long (https://github.com/ac3xx) for spotting a bug.

This code was developed in order to do/verify part of a coursework in my 2nd Year. I have recently started to implement some QuickChecking into the mix, however this will have to wait until I have some more time!

Also in the repository are two PDF files. `notes.pdf` are the relevant lecture notes in order to understand some background behind the task in the coursework, I have labelled methods with slide numbers which will help to understand what the code achieves. `cw.pdf` is the coursework sheet we were presented, this code helps to solve questions 1c and 2.

Possible extensions could include adding LaTeX formatting to some of the `Show` instances.
